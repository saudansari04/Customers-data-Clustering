Objective: To apply k-means clustering algorihm to segment the customers for decision making


K-means Algorithm:

K-Means falls under the category of centroid-based clustering. A centroid is a data point (imaginary or real) at the center of a cluster. In centroid-based clustering, clusters are represented by a central vector. This centroid might not necessarily be a member of the dataset. Centroid-based clustering is an iterative algorithm in which the notion of similarity is derived by how close a data point is to the centroid of the cluster.
